<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p class="indent">The pictures in this album are reproduced from
actual photographs taken in Europe, many of which
have already appeared, in more or less crude form, in
the newspapers.</p>

<p class="indent">Believing that these photographs of men and events
in the most stupendous war of the world&#39;s history
possess a world wide interest, and will be of permanent
historical value, we have reproduced them in the actual
colors of life, and in form which is more worthy of
preservation than the mere half tone newspaper cuts.</p>

<p class="indent">The pictures were published for sale in post cards.
But when we saw how attractive they were, it occurred
to us to gather them together in this album and present
it to our customers.</p>

<p class="indent">Please accept it with our compliments, and as an
expression of our appreciation of your confidence in
us and of the business we have received from you.</p>

<h2>French Cuirassiers Helping a
Wounded Comrade at St.
Quentin</h2>

<p class="indent">The cuirassiers are heavy cavalry
for charging, not scouting.
The French and German armies
have each twelve regiments, and
the Russians four. They are a
survival of the 17th century, wearing
steel cuirasses and helmets
with horsehair plumes. Napoleon
III&#39;s bodyguard, &quot;Les Cents-Gardes,&quot;
wore aluminum. They
carry a long double-edged stabbing
sword. St. Quentin was on the
French route of retreat to Paris
in the first stage of the war.</p>

<h2>The Terrible Turcos&mdash;Native
Algerians in the French
Army</h2>

<p class="indent">These are not negroes, but men
of Berber origin with black beards
and tanned faces. They are recruited
in Algiers and are called
&quot;tirailleurs algieriens.&quot; Their
headgear is the characteristic fez.
The object resembling a football
which they carry on the hip is a
water bottle.</p>

<p class="indent">In the war of 1870 these troops
became greatly feared and hated
by the Germans, because of their
trick of &quot;playing possum&quot; until the
enemy passed and then springing
up and striking from the rear.
They are impetuous fighters, and
the difficulty the French generals
find in their employment is to hold
them back at times when to charge
the enemy is foolhardy.</p>

<h2>Sharp Shooters of France</h2>

<p class="indent">There are thirty battalions of
&quot;chausseurs alpins,&quot; who spend half
each year in the French Alps. Each
carries an alpenstock and a pack.
They are among the hardiest and
best trained French infantry, skilled
with the rifle and in mountain warfare.
Among the Vosges Mountains
they tied themselves in trees,
so when wounded they would not
drop and betray their position.</p>

<p class="indent">The mule is a useful creature
in time of war&mdash;especially in the
commissary department, to carry
pots, pans and provisions. Like
the burro of the American southwest,
the Alpine mule is a sure-footed
climber.</p>

<h2>The Famous Scots Greys</h2>

<p class="indent">The Royal Scots Greys were the
first regiment of dragoons raised
in Great Britain (1681). There
are now half a score of dragoon
guard and dragoon regiments, all
mounted and equipped as medium
heavy cavalry. They are armed
with carbine and sabre, and wear
metal helmets (except the Scots
Greys). This noted regiment has
served with distinction in all parts
of the world, and has already
counted big in the British defense
in France and Belgium. The
&quot;Grey&quot; does not refer to the uniform,
but to the horses, which all
have their tails trimmed half-short.</p>

<h2>The Grenadier Guards&mdash;British

<p class="indent">In the Boer War the Grenadier
Guards shared the brunt of the
fighting, and it was in South Africa
that their leader lost his arm.</p>

<h2>British Field Artillery at the
Marne</h2>

<p class="indent">This 18-pound ordnance is of
English make, and will shoot both
faster and farther than the Krupp
guns. Its caliber is 3.3 inches,
and the muzzle velocity 1,600 feet
per second. The gunners are able
to get away 29 shots per minute,
while the German rate of fire is
only twenty. The maximum effective
range is 6,300 yards against
6,000 for any other gun of its class.
Each gun and carriage weighs
2,690 pounds. There are six guns
in a battery, and the number of
rounds of ammunition normally issued
is 176 per gun.</p>

<h2>Canadian Troops Off for the
War</h2>

<p class="indent">The loyalty and enthusiasm of
the Dominion at this critical time
is very impressive. The picture
shows the Ninetieth Winnipeg
Rifles on the march from the training
camp at Valcartier, eighteen
miles north of Quebec&mdash;the largest
practice encampment ever established
in America. Many of
Canada&#39;s soldiers are veterans of
the British army; some saw service
in South Africa; the rest are intelligent
farmers&#39; sons or young business
men from the cities. Thirty-three
thousand Canadians disembarked
at Plymouth on October 14,
with more to follow.</p>

<h2>Exhausted French Dragoons
Camping in Village Street</h2>

<p class="indent">Dragoons were originally trained
to fight either on horseback or
afoot. Many of them carry bamboo
lances, said to be even stronger
than steel. The term &quot;dragoon&quot;
probably comes from the dragon
worked on the muzzle of the old
carbine they used to carry, as dragons
were supposed to spout fire.
The bivouac on piles of straw, with
weapons stacked ready for instant
service, suggests vividly the condition
of soldiers in the intervals of
hard fighting. This is an actual
scene on the line of retreat toward
Paris.</p>

<h2>German Field Artillery</h2>

<p class="indent">The splendid &quot;fitness&quot; of the
German artilleryman is illustrated
by these vigorous, intelligent fellows,
smiling at the photographer
as he snapped them. They might
be riding to a picnic, instead of to
awful war. Their helmets are
tipped with a brass ball instead of
a spike such as the infantry have,
in order that the eyes may not be
injured when the men bend over
the guns to aim them. The box,
or caisson, on which two men are
sitting, contains projectiles and
equipment for use in serving the
gun.</p>

<h2>The Famous 75 Millimeter
French Guns at the Marne</h2>

<p class="indent">The French guns, by many military
experts, are said to be superior
to any other field artillery. Their
bore is only 2.95 inches, but the
initial velocity and accuracy are
greater than the German guns, and
their lightness makes them more
mobile in action. A battery has
about the same effect on an advancing
line as a mowing-machine on
a harvest field.</p>

<h2>French Hussars at Rouen</h2>

<p class="indent">The Hussars are light cavalry
intended for scouting, and use
much smaller horses than the cuirassiers.
Many French race-horses
were seized by the government for
the use of these troops, and a maximum
price of $200 was paid,
though some of the thoroughbreds
were valued at $10,000 by their
owners.</p>

<p class="indent">In the background are seen the
towers of the cathedral at Rouen,
which is a quaint, old Norman
town, the capital of William the
Conqueror, before he crossed the
Channel.</p>

<h2>French Line Infantry Passing
Monument of Napoleon</h2>

<p class="indent">The monument is near the village
of Vauchamps, where the
French defeated Blucher and the
Prussians on February 14, 1814.
It is in the Department of the
Marne: scene of the first victory
of the allies in the present war.</p>

<p class="indent">Red caps and trousers have been
the uniform of French soldiers
since Napoleon&#39;s day, but they provide
the enemy with a good target,
and are poorly suited to modern
campaigning. The Germans, however,
gave France no time to equip
her army with khaki, and the
French soldiers took the field in
their historic garb.</p>

<h2>Terrible Uhlans</h2>

<p class="indent">This variety of light cavalry was
introduced into central Europe by
the Tartars of Asia in the middle
ages. They were armed with sabre,
pistol and lance, at first carried in
the left hand. The pennon is intended
to frighten the enemy&#39;s
horses, and identifies the men as
Prussians. The Poles, Austrians,
and Russians also adopted uhlans.
In the Franco-Prussian War of
1870 they led the invasion of
northern France, and won great
fame by their fearless activity.</p>

<h2>Feeding the Men in the Trenches&mdash;A
German Field Bakery</h2>

<p class="indent">Napoleon said &quot;An army travels
on its stomach.&quot; This is part of
the wonderful German organization
for supplying the men in the
field with daily bread. Each
wagon supplies 1,600 men&mdash;there
are twenty-five with each army
corps of 40,000. The war ration
includes bread, biscuit, eggs, meat,
beans, rice, dried vegetables, salt
and coffee.</p>

<h2>The German Defense Against
the Airship&mdash;Krupp Gun on
Motor</h2>

<p class="indent">This is one of the deadly Krupp
aeroplane guns, mounted on a Mercedes
auto truck. The rear wheels
are braced to steady the gun from
vibration under the heavy shock of
firing.</p>

<p class="indent">An aeroplane is a very difficult
target, not only on account of its
rapid flight, but also because the
only vital spots are the engine and
the passengers.</p>

<h2>Crack Austrian Regiment
from Vienna</h2>

<p class="indent">Austrian military traditions are
equal to any in Europe. In the
sixteenth century they turned back
the tide of Turkish conquest and
saved Europe. Military service is
compulsory on all able-bodied
males from 20 to 42, and totals
twelve years&mdash;three in the line,
seven in reserve, and two in the
&quot;Landwehr.&quot; The long trousers
worn by these troops show that
they are recruited from the Germanic
part of the empire&mdash;for the
Austrian army, like the empire itself,
contains men speaking twenty-six

<h2>Cossacks&mdash;The Rough Riders
of Russia</h2>

<p class="indent">The Cossacks of the river Don
pay no taxes, but are liable to military
service from eighteen to fifty,
and each must furnish his own
horse. They are wonderful riders,
and excellent scouts or skirmishers.
Their hollow circle formation is
a favorite one for defense.</p>

<p class="indent">The government is so arranged
as to furnish the largest military
array on the shortest notice. In
personal appearance, the Cossacks
are more slender and handsomer
than the Russians.</p>

<h2>Russian Regulars on the March
Through Galicia</h2>

<p class="indent">Contrary to popular impression,
the number of trained men in the
Russian army is no greater than
in the German. The number of
recruits available is, of course,
much larger.</p>

<p class="indent">The Russian infantry is famous
for close fighting with the bayonet,
which is made a part of the gun
and cannot be removed. The faces
of the men are a distinctively Slavic
type. They are patient, enduring,
brave, and fight with a stubborn
tenacity which has wrecked the
hopes of every general in history
who attempted the invasion and
conquest of their territory.</p>

<h2>The Black Watch</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;Faithful, constant, generous in
the hour of victory, and endued
with calm perseverance under trial
and disaster,&quot; the Highlanders of
Scotland have won conspicuous
honor on England&#39;s many battlefields.</p>

<p class="indent">These are the men who are said
in the present war to have repeated
the famous charge made by
their ancestors at Waterloo a century
ago. Each infantryman,
grasping the stirrup of a cavalryman
of the Scots Greys, kept pace
with the horses, as the two regiments
rushed with terrific momentum
against the hostile lines.</p>

<h2>German Hussars in Brussels</h2>

<p class="indent">Not all German cavalrymen are
Uhlans. The Hussars also are
light cavalry, adapted for reconnoitering.
Both Uhlans and Hussars
carry lances over ten feet long,
made of a single steel tube drawn
to a tempered point, with a pennon
fluttering from it. In actual conflict
these are usually removed.
The color of the pennon shows
from what state of the Empire the
troopers come&mdash;the black-and-white
ones in the picture show that they
are Prussians.</p>

<h2>England&#39;s Indian Regiment</h2>

<p class="indent">Here is the pride of India&#39;s contingent,
70,000 native troops&mdash;Sikhs
and Ghurkas from the Himalayas,
Bengal lancers from the
Ganges, and Mahrata infantrymen
from the torrid central plains.
They wear their turbans even in
Europe, where the remainder of
the uniform is khaki.</p>

<p class="indent">The helmeted officers are Englishmen.
The Indians have already
proved their courage and skill
against the Germans. Like all the
regulars of the British army, they
are wonderful bayonet fighters.</p>

<h2>A Detachment of the French
Aviation Corps</h2>

<p class="indent">The aeroplane is one of the factors
that have revolutionized modern
warfare. Its use for dropping
bombs on hostile cities gives it a
spectacular place in the news columns
of to-day, but its real military
value consists in scouting,
getting the range for artillery, and
preventing surprises by the enemy.</p>

<p class="indent">The French army is thoroughly
equipped with the swiftest monoplanes
in Europe, and the French
are wonderful aviators&mdash;skillful,
fearless, and resourceful.</p>

<h2>One of Germany&#39;s Mammoth
Zeppelins</h2>

<p class="indent">These great dirigible airships,
hundreds of feet long, were invented
and perfected by the aged
Count Zeppelin. They are effective
within a range of one thousand
miles. The German Empire has
unquestionably surpassed all its
rivals in Europe in the thorough
application of the inventions of
modern science to the making of
war.</p>

<p class="indent">In the right background is seen
the hangar, or shed, in which the
craft is housed. The sheep have
become accustomed to the hovering
giant and feed quietly under it.</p>

<h2>Ready for the Uhlans&mdash;Belgian
Armored Motor Cars</h2>

<p class="indent">The flat lowlands of Belgium
and northern France are networked
with perfect roads, making possible
very rapid movement of troops.
Armored motor cars have been
much used by all the armies, especially
as escorts for aviators. The
car on the left carries a machine
gun; the one on the right is simply
armored with sheet steel to stand
heavy fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The Belgians employed these
cars extensively in the first month
of the war, in their attempt to prevent
the raids of the German cavalry.</p>

<h2>The Prussian Crown Prince&#39;s
Regiment</h2>

<p class="indent">The Crown Prince is always
colonel of the Death&#39;s Head Hussars,
and when he had a &quot;difference&quot;
with his father a few years
ago, the Kaiser exiled him to his
command at Danzig, where the
regiment was permanently stationed.
In state reviews the Crown
Princess often appears in her
Death&#39;s Head uniform as honorary
colonel. Naturally, German noblemen
are eager to join this regiment,
which is one of the &quot;crack&quot; organizations
of the Prussian army.</p>

<h2>British Artillery Embarking for

<p class="indent">This is one of the barges used
to carry horses and guns to the
transport ship. The horses are then
lifted into the vessel by means of a
belt around their bellies. Some of
the jackies have taken off their
shoes and stockings and rolled up
their trousers. The artilleryman,
partly hidden behind his mount, is
dressed in khaki.</p>

<h2>Canadian Royal Horse Artillery
Mobilizing</h2>

<p class="indent">This is part of Canada&#39;s splendid
contribution to the defense of
the motherland. The Royal Horse
were among the first contingent of
33,000 to embark&mdash;Canada pledged
200,000 altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">Canadian horses are noted for
their strength and beauty. They
play a large part in the development
of Canada&#39;s rich agricultural
resources, and the Royal Artillery
took the finest of Canadian horses
across with them.</p>

<h2>The Surprise of the War&mdash;The
New German Siege Gun</h2>

<p class="indent">These are the guns that battered
Namur into ruins, reduced Meubeuge,
and were employed in the
capture of Antwerp. The Germans
demonstrated their marvelous
efficiency in the &quot;art of war&quot; by
keeping the existence of these fort-destroyers
a complete secret until
they were ready to use them against
Belgium and France.</p>

<p class="indent">The guns are transported in sections
by rail as far as possible, and
then by great traction engines.
The block of wood in the cannon&#39;s
mouth protects the chamber from
dust and rust.</p>

<h2>Belgian War Dogs</h2>

<p class="indent">One of the most interesting
sidelights of the war is the use of
dogs to draw the Belgian &quot;mitrailleuses.&quot;
All who have visited
Belgium have been surprised at
the amount of work, such as hauling
market wagons, performed by
these animals. The rubber-tired
gun carriage is in strange contrast
with the bizarre appearance of the
&quot;dogs of war&quot;&mdash;tired out after a
stiff march.</p>

<p class="indent">This &quot;pictorial map&quot; was offered in October by The Osborne Company, as a calendar, and as a hanger without calendar pad. It met with instant approval
and our available presses have scarcely been able to keep pace with the sales. The business of The Osborne Company in the United States, since the outbreak
of war, has been the largest of any corresponding months in our history. We think this fact is a splendid symptom of reviving and growing business in
America, which is bound to extend while the rest of the world continues to need more and more products of our fields and factories.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>THE NATIONS AT WAR</h2>

<h3>SERVIA</h3>

<p class="indent">Servia is an independent kingdom. The capital is
Belgrade. For centuries Servia was a province of the
Turkish Empire, constantly in revolt and passionately
striving to become independent. By the Treaty of
Berlin in 1878 Servian independence was secured.
With the triumph of the Balkan Allies&mdash;Servia, Montenegro,
Bulgaria and Greece&mdash;over Turkey in 1913,
much valuable territory was added to all the Balkan
nations. The great ambition of Servia to secure territory
on the sea was thwarted, however, by Austria-Hungary;
and the ancient Servian hatred for Austria,
roused to action, brought about the incident immediately
leading to the great European War.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the assassination of the Austrian crown
prince, in June, by a Servian conspirator. Austria
claimed that the Servian government was a party to
the murder, and sent an ultimatum making peremptory
demands that the murderers be punished. The
Servian government, denying any connection with the
assassins, none the less agreed to all the Austrian demands
save one. They refused to permit Austrian
officials to try the conspiracy cases. Austria declared
war.</p>

<h3>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY</h3>

<p class="indent">A dual monarchy, inhabited by several nationalities
and comprising two semi-independent countries, each
with its own government but also with a common
parliament, army and emperor, Francis Joseph. He
belongs to the house of Hapsburg, which has ruled
Austria for six hundred years, and himself has held the
throne at Vienna since 1848.</p>

<p class="indent">Austria possesses important ports on the Adriatic,
and if she had territory in the Balkan peninsula might
gain access to the Mediterranean and prevent Russia
from doing the same. She once tried to reach the sea
through Italy, but failed. The growth of the Slavic
states in the Balkans is directly contrary to Austrian
interests and ambitions. A power occupying the Balkan
peninsula might easily control the Suez Canal, connecting
Europe with the Orient.</p>

<p class="indent">Agriculture is the principal pursuit, and Austria is
able to supply her own food. In the north, wheat and
barley grow, and corn in the south. The mineral wealth
is great&mdash;coal and salt abound. Cotton, woolen, linen
and silk goods are manufactured; also metals, glass,
leather and musical instruments. Commerce is mainly
with Germany and Turkey.</p>

<h3>GERMANY</h3>

<p class="indent">Twenty-five states constitute the German Empire,
formed by the first imperial chancellor, Bismarck, in
1871. Its capital is Berlin. The king of Prussia is
emperor (William II, since 1888). He may declare
war and conclude peace, contract alliances and make
treaties.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
The German people are intelligent and industrious.
Since the founding of the empire their industrial and
commercial development has been wonderful. Less
than half the population is now engaged in agriculture,
but Germany still produces the larger part of
her food supply. Almost one-third as many cattle are
raised as in the United States, and Germany leads the
world in sugar production.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonial expansion, commerce, and the need of food
imports has built up a great German merchant marine
and navy. If Austria were part of the Empire, with
a path to the Mediterranean, Germany would have
the harbors and seaways needed to increase her maritime
power and would also possess the shortest trade
route to the Orient. Bismarck wanted to secure
Germany from attack, so that she could develop her
industries in peace, and with this end in view made
alliances with Austria and Italy, at the same time
encouraging naval and military growth.</p>

<h3>RUSSIA</h3>

<p class="indent">One of the most powerful countries, including all
northern Asia as well as eastern Europe. It is an
absolute monarchy, ruled by the Czar Nicholas II at
Petrograd (St. Petersburg). He came to the throne
in 1894.</p>

<p class="indent">The population is mostly Slavic, and the racial sympathy
is therefore with the Balkan peoples. Russia,
like Austria and Germany, would like a port on the
Mediterranean, as she now has access to the Atlantic
only through the Baltic Sea and the Dardanelles (between
the Black Sea and the Ægean).</p>

<p class="indent">Sixty years ago Russia attacked Turkey, menacing
Great Britain&#39;s route to her Oriental possessions.
These two powers combined with France and repulsed
Russia in the Crimean War. Since the time of Peter
the Great the Russians have had their eyes on Constantinople,
and as long as they cannot have it will try
to prevent Germany or Austria from getting it.</p>

<p class="indent">Seven-eighths of the peasants are farmers, and two-thirds
of the land is sown to cereals.</p>

<h3>FRANCE</h3>

<p class="indent">A republic. Paris is the capital, and the president
(since 1913) is Raymond Poincare. It is more than
three-fourths the size of Texas, and has about two-fifths
the population of the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the people live by agriculture, which is
carried to a high standard. Wheat, oats, barley and
corn are grown, also root-crops, fruits, tobacco, grapes
and silk. There are rich mines of coal, iron and lead.
In 1912 France ranked fourth in imports and exports.
In manufactures of silk the French predominate, and
they make fine muslins, porcelains, glass, jewelry and
clocks.</p>

<h3>GREAT BRITAIN</h3>

<p class="indent">The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy,
comprising England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
London is the capital, and George V, since 1910, has
been King of Great Britain and Emperor of India.
The coast line measures about twenty-eight hundred
miles, and the English navy is equal to any other two.
&quot;The sun never sets on her colonial possessions,&quot; and
her world-trade is the largest of any nation.</p>

<p class="indent">Manufacturing is the leading industry. Most of
the large cities are near the coal-fields in the north
central part. London, Liverpool and Edinburgh are
the principal ports.</p>

<p class="indent">England has no fear of losing India, but does not
look with favor on Russia&#39;s Balkan ambitions. At
the same time she is opposed to the spread of a great
German empire from Holland to the Ægean Sea,
which would upset the English doctrine of small independent
states and the &quot;balance of power&quot; in Europe.</p>

<h3>BELGIUM</h3>

<p class="indent">A democratic kingdom ruled by Albert, since 1909
(capital Brussels). Its length is 165 miles and width
120; the population about 650 to the square mile,
composed of Flemish and Walloons&mdash;the former of
French and the latter of German extraction.</p>

<p class="indent">Belgium is low and flat in the north; hilly and timbered
in the south. The country is well watered and
networked with canals. Rich in minerals, it is a
prominent manufacturing country. Linens, laces, cottons
and woolens, carpets, machines and cutlery are
exported, with coal, iron and farm products. The
imports are coffee, sugar, petroleum, hides and raw
materials. Agriculture is carried to great perfection,
but the country is not self-supporting.</p>

<p class="indent">Brussels is a great manufacturing center, and Antwerp
the principal seaport.</p>

<h3>ITALY</h3>

<p class="indent">The king of Italy is Victor Emmanuel III, whose
rule began in 1900. The products are fruits, rice,
wheat, silk, olives, marble, etc. Naples is the largest
city, and has varied manufactures.</p>

<p class="indent">Previous to 1859 Italy was divided into separate
states. In 1870 Victor Emmanuel, king of Sardinia,
united Italy and made Rome the national capital.
Austria tried to thwart this movement. England and
France were friendly to Italy at that time, and Germany
was neutral.</p>

<h2>ALLIANCES</h2>

<p class="indent">The Triple Alliance was formed by Bismarck, after
the Franco-Prussian War. Its object was to strengthen
Germany and isolate France. A dual league was
made in 1879 between Austria and Germany, which
Italy joined in 1880. By this alliance the nations
intended to aid each other in defense. Bismarck
wanted Russia in the league, but trouble in the
Balkans broke off this project.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after France formed a league with Russia.
Bismarck fell from power in 1890, but the Triple
Alliance was still stronger than its rival, until France
brought England into the Triple Entente, agreeing
to give England a free hand in Egypt in return for the
same in Morocco.</p>

<h2>STRATEGY</h2>

<p class="indent">The German attack on France is weakened by the
fact that Italy did not act with the other members of
the Triple Alliance, as a diverting attack from the
south would divide the French defense. From the map
it is easy to see why Germany advanced through Belgium,
in spite of the fact that Germany, in 1878, had
been one of the powers to guarantee Belgium&#39;s neutrality,
because the mountains bordering France from
the Alps to Verdun were strongly fortified, while the
approach from Belgium was not.</p>

<p class="indent">It is also clear that Russia was compelled to establish
her position along the Carpathian Mountains before
advancing on Berlin&mdash;so that a northward movement
from Austria-Hungary might not cut her line of communication.</p>

<h2>The Effect of the War on Osborne
Art Calendars for 1916</h2>

<p class="indent">You probably know that the outbreak of war immediately resulted in a
scarcity of dye stuffs. In the calendar business this has affected inks for
color printing, paints for water colors, coloring matter for ribbon, paper and
cord. The rag used in high grade paper was also affected, and to some
extent even the clay for enameled stock&mdash;part of this material coming from
the war area.</p>

<p class="indent">The Osborne Company acted promptly in the crisis. Taking advantage
of the large capital fortunately at our command, we purchased outright
practically an entire year&#39;s supply of materials, at prices which cannot be
duplicated today for materials of equal grade.</p>

<p class="indent">As a result the new line of Osborne Art Calendars for 1916 will be sold to
our customers at no advance in price, and there will be no deterioration in
quality through the substitution of inferior or untested materials.</p>

<p class="indent">On the contrary, the new line will offer you unexpected value for
every dollar of your calendar appropriation.</p>

<p class="indent">It is absolutely, in all respects, the superlative line&mdash;the masterpiece&mdash;of
the 25 years of progress since this Company originated the art calendar
business.</p>

<p class="indent">Do not buy in haste&mdash;before you see Osborne Art Calendars for 1916.
Wait&mdash;the reward will be better and more attractive advertising, a subject
yours exclusively for your town (no jobber&#39;s calendar gives you this important
service) and the greatest value any calendar house does or can offer you
for your money.</p>

<p class="indent">The Osborne man will surely call. Wait for him in your own interest.</p>
